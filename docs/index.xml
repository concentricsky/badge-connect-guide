      <description>Introduction Badge Connect API, released as Open Badges 2.1 brings the concept of a Federated backpack to the Open Badges ecosystem. A backpack is a service that acts as an agent for a recipient of Open Badges.
You can view code examples of each section of the guide.
Application Types Applications in the Badge Connect-enabled Open Badges ecosystem fall into two main roles. Host (Backpack) and Relying Party. Relying Party applications typically serve functions as either an Issuer of badges, which provides recognition to recipients, or a Displayer of badges, which helps make badges meaningful or translate them back into some kind of real world value or new opportunity for their earners.</description>

      <description>Badge Connect Applications This section of the guide will explain how to get started with a relying party application for Badge Connect. Both Issuer apps and Displayer apps need to go through several common processes before the workflows for their specific needs diverge. Here we will explain these steps, including:
 Backpack Selection Dynamic Client Registration The OAuth Dance: Authorization Code &amp;amp; Token Exchange Refreshing Tokens  Then the remaining sections of the guide will provide step-by-step instructions for accessing the API endpoints necessary to build Issuer and Displayer applications.</description>
